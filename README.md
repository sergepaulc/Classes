## A Gentle Introduction to Machine Learning for Product¬†Managers

I taught a machine learning class to Product Managers a few years ago. I have slightly updated the content of that class. A lot of Product Managers working on machine learning are contacting me on LinkedIn. So, I am hoping that the following materials might be useful to someone.

There are six classes. The seventh class is a final project where students present a machine learning application.

Each class has a powerpoint presentation and include readings, videos to watch, and homework.

The most difficult concepts are presented and discussed in multiple classes in an incremental way.

## Class 1
[ML University for PM Class 1](https://siliconvalleyinsider.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ml-university-for-pm-class-1.pdf)

Videos:
- Professor Andrew Ng: Artificial Intelligence is the New Electricity at Stanford GSB:¬†https://youtu.be/21EiKfQYZXc

Readings:
- Wikipedia: Linear regression¬†https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression
- Wikipedia: Logistic regression¬†https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression
- Wikipedia: K-means clustering¬†https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering¬†

Homework:
1. You have been hired to be the first Product Manager, Program Manager, or Designer for a new online store. Your first assignment is to lead the development of an ML application for classifying the products across various categories that will be available on the store. Consider that the store will provide up to 500 products from many suppliers across many types of categories for consumers such as home decoration, cooking, fashion, fitness‚Ä¶To get started on that assignment, please propose a small draft of your proposed plan for that app. Please put your thoughts in the same google document that you use for your previous homework.
2. Since you completed ahead of schedule and with a lower budget your classification app, you are now being asked to develop a segmentation app for the customers that will be visiting and purchasing on the store. That app could leverage the labels of your classification apps. Please put your thoughts in the same google document that you use for your previous homework.
Note: You can be as creative as you want in terms of the product plan that you will use to drive the development of those apps but at least describe the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of the apps, the data sources/features, the possible models, and any KPIs. If you are running out of time, just do something simple in a few sentences for each homework in ¬Ω page. If you have time, do as much as you can üôÇ

Homework:
1. You have been hired to be the first Product Designer, Product Manager, or Program Manager for the Intelligence Platform at Sony Kamaji. Your first assignment is to lead the development of an ML application for classifying Sony games. To get started on that assignment, please propose a small draft of your proposed plan for that app. Please put your thoughts in the same google document that you use for your previous homework.
2. Since you completed ahead of schedule and with a lower budget your classification app for Sony games, you are now being asked to develop a segmentation app of SONY users. That app could leverage the labels of your classification apps. Please put your thoughts in the same google document that you use for your previous homework.

Note: You can be as creative as you want in terms of the product plan that you will use to drive the development of those apps but at least describe the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of the apps, the data sources/features, the possible models, and any KPIs.
